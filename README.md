# Checkers
A comprehensive two-player checkers game coded using Java Swing. 
This game uses standard American checkers rules, instructions for which 
can be found in a pop-up panel prior to running the game and also at 
https://www.ultraboardgames.com/checkers/game-rules.php

Added functionality includes an undo function and a save function. The 
"undo" button will reverse a single previous move, not the entire turn.
The "save" button will store the game's moves in the checkers.text text
file, which can be opened and used to restore the game status via 
the "open" button.

This game is two player, meaning that only pieces of the player whose 
turn it is can be selected and moved. 
- To select a piece, click on it and
if it is valid, the piece will display a cyan outline as well as its 
possible moves. 
- To move, select the square of the desired move. 
- For jumping moves involving multiple jumps, the player may choose how 
many jumps to take. To end the turn, simply click on the piece again.
To continue jumping, simply continue clicking on the desired square of 
the jump. Enjoy playing!
